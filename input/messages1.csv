2980211	2009-11-01 11:43:00	its so bright out too bad its not going to last.
2980211	2009-11-01 12:12:53	the nightly report from friday says we didnt need that stinkin conway anyway. i feel so loved. :p
2980211	2009-11-01 13:45:13	due to an excellent colllaborative effort between some people who are up far too early on a sunday, i have my words. thank you. :)
2980211	2009-11-01 14:45:54	@mrsfridaynext wednesdays are my dd night for the forseeable future...
2980211	2009-11-01 15:12:01	@mrsfridaynext i must discuss this further with the roommate. i will keep you posted.
2980211	2009-11-01 15:15:58	@mrsfridaynext therefore, this whole endeavor will be much cheaper all the transport will cost is gas and tolls. :)
2980211	2009-11-01 15:18:37	@mrsfridaynext yup no giving piles of cash to zipcar
2980211	2009-11-01 15:19:39	@mrsfridaynext i was thinking about making you in charge of the travel music, if youre game for such responsibility.
2980211	2009-11-01 15:22:04	@mrsfridaynext i am 95 certain that autumns car has a mini headphone jack connection in it, so ipods are good. and cds too.
2980211	2009-11-01 15:53:28	so do i...rt @sumrtime: i want this magnet. http://yfrog.com/j4f5lj
2980211	2009-11-01 19:02:28	@mrsfridaynext 95 certain means that im 100 certain but factoring for the possibility of her ripping it out. which is unlikely.
2980211	2009-11-01 20:10:57	@librarygurl yup. whoever is wearing a bra has to go downstairs. and i was all dressed on account of having to go to work.
2980211	2009-11-01 23:45:15	the sheer possibility of maddie coming to stay with us between christmas and new years has me all excited

2980211	2009-11-02 03:47:44	the girl sitting next to me just took the same pic with her phone that i was thinking would be a nice shot. i feel so validated.
2980211	2009-11-02 12:12:17	@jmgold and now youre intentionally trying to make me jealous, which is so working.
2980211	2009-11-02 12:16:31	im starting to get a little concerned about the frequency with which im getting headaches lately. my head feels like its in a vice grip.
2980211	2009-11-02 12:17:33	@jmgold not really. as much as i love a good schadenfreude, that just sounds awful. :/
2980211	2009-11-02 13:15:24	@booksnyarn im really not sure how you managed to survive the weekend...
2980211	2009-11-02 13:15:42	@sumrtime thank you. i will try my best.
2980211	2009-11-02 14:05:08	@amandamcneil not if your cell phone has a tricky snooze feature i think the answer here is an atomic clock. @booksnyarn
2980211	2009-11-02 14:05:57	trying to decide if more caffeine is a good idea.
2980211	2009-11-02 14:52:40	@jmgold oh no, i think i get exactly what you mean.
2980211	2009-11-02 14:53:51	@desiredeffect oh, that sounds horrible. on the other hand, now im wondering if im dehydrated.
2980211	2009-11-02 20:53:23	@amandamcneil if youre down for our weirdass thanksgiving youre certainly welcome to join us.
2980211	2009-11-02 20:56:14	@amandamcneil heres a tip. only try to punch in copies in increments of 10. anymore than that and the system freezes up.
2980211	2009-11-02 21:18:03	rachel just got out of bed. for the day. i want to shoot myself.
2980211	2009-11-02 21:22:25	im actually a little horrified that my headache killing strategy list is as long as it is.
2980211	2009-11-02 23:03:19	@jmgold dammit. now all of the internet is going to revolt against me. im screwed.
2980211	2009-11-02 23:28:47	the air coming in from the window smells like birthday candles.
2980211	2009-11-03 00:30:23	am now actually worried that my dentist is going to yell at me.
2980211	2009-11-03 01:00:45	lars and the painfully awkward adolescence. #unseenprequels
2980211	2009-11-03 01:44:17	i mustered up the strength to stay up another half an hour, but im throwing in the towel. hopefully tomorrow will feel better.
2980211	2009-11-03 01:47:13	@madstuart yes, another strike against james camerons movie for stealing the name of my favorite animated series ever.
2980211	2009-11-03 02:14:25	@amandamcneil sea salt will probably hurt
2980211	2009-11-03 02:29:03	@jmgold scared the hell out of me.
2980211	2009-11-03 02:50:45	@jmgold i certainly hope so.
2980211	2009-11-03 12:13:36	of course, its so not my fault. im not the one that decides how much rum goes in the nog.
2980211	2009-11-03 13:39:12	i love it when payday hits and im already pretty much out of money. still blaming having to buy that plane ticket home.
2980211	2009-11-03 13:42:58	@amandamcneil yeah. ive already talked to my parents about how we should all cut way back on our gift giving this year. theyre into it.
2980211	2009-11-03 13:44:51	@amandamcneil maybe, when im not in school, ill have time to actually attempt some sewing projects and i can make stuff next year.
2980211	2009-11-03 13:51:27	i think this is very similar to what happened when i met terry moore. http://bit.ly/3fjzzl minus the nosebleed.
2980211	2009-11-03 14:07:38	@booksnyarn maybe you have some sort of yarnbased organism thats reproducing in there. @amandamcneil @helgagrace
2980211	2009-11-03 14:08:19	@amandamcneil yeah, what @jpetroroy said. i think they want you to start it.
2980211	2009-11-03 14:31:51	@librarygurl which is probably not the best strategy ever for improving my writing.
2980211	2009-11-03 14:35:23	@librarygurl one of my ideas would make a fairly decent webcomic, if i could bring myself to show anyone my doodles.
2980211	2009-11-03 14:40:22	@booksnyarn i started journaling this weekend for the first time in months. its strangely exhausting. @amandamcneil @librarygurl
2980211	2009-11-03 14:40:57	@amandamcneil once my friends and i discussed how much money wed have to be given to lick one of the poles on the t. my lower limit was 50
2980211	2009-11-03 14:41:29	@amandamcneil this was the lowest amount among all of us. but its better than my sister who licked a bar floor for 5.
2980211	2009-11-03 14:48:47	@amandamcneil mostly, i think it stems from a mutual love of freaking other people out. we all seem to have that gene.
2980211	2009-11-03 14:49:27	@amandamcneil i can hear in my head my mother saying accusingly, you just like making people uncomfortable. thats not nice, amy.

2980211	2009-11-03 15:11:13	@jmgold i fell asleep while watching it, i was so bored. there are some good moments, though.
2980211	2009-11-03 15:23:07	@amandamcneil yes i love cooking with other people. its always fun. :)
2980211	2009-11-03 15:27:46	@amandamcneil at zombie movies, i need someone there to punch me in the arm when i laugh at moments that are too inappropriate. @jmgold
2980211	2009-11-03 15:33:10	@booksnyarn @amandamcneil youd think my name was too short to fuck up, but no. i get jamie a lot.

2980211	2009-11-03 15:46:41	@jmgold after i left, i heard that he started calling katherine (the new props master) amy. that kind of made it better.
2980211	2009-11-03 16:08:04	@jmgold lord knows i deserve it. :) @booksnyarn
2980211	2009-11-03 16:08:40	@amandamcneil wow, it took a whole 4 months for anyone from #teamunicorn to bring up conway twitty. @jmgold @booksnyarn
2980211	2009-11-03 16:19:22	@amandamcneil ps  im not actually offended by the conway twitty thing. im just glad youre not calling me that. :)
2980211	2009-11-03 17:02:12	@amandamcneil well a lot of other people do, and its fucking annoying.
2980211	2009-11-03 18:51:55	@amandamcneil im kind of surprised that my ohiou webspace seems to still be intact...
2980211	2009-11-03 20:55:31	oh, ohio...rt @thisamericanliz: rt @erinmckeown passed this church on the way to ann arbor today. http://twitpic.com/o5pdo
2980211	2009-11-03 23:11:20	okay, ive decided if this headache is still here tomorrow, im calling the doctor. someone hold me to this...
2980211	2009-11-04 00:55:35	@amandamcneil on the bus this morning there was a guy that didnt even try to hide the fact that he was trying to look down my shirt.
2980211	2009-11-04 01:14:26	@hipsterplease one could almost think they were trying to market to nerds or something...
2980211	2009-11-04 01:26:40	the dayton dailys website is really something awful. ugh.
2980211	2009-11-04 01:30:45	@amandamcneil i have never gotten to that point, but it takes a whole heck of a lot to scare me.
2980211	2009-11-04 01:32:18	on the other hand, im taking comfort in the fact that less than 1 of precincts are reporting on issue 2. god, that issue is shady.
2980211	2009-11-04 01:44:45	@sonorandragon it was doing that whole not updating my homepage thing again. :p
2980211	2009-11-04 02:00:06	okay, you know whats going to kill #v the fact that i saw the whole pilot and dont give a shit about any of the characters.
2980211	2009-11-04 02:03:50	@amandamcneil strangely, my main pet peeve with the new version is that they changed dianas name to anna.
2980211	2009-11-04 02:30:18	@amandamcneil yeah, youre probably going to be saying that often.
2980211	2009-11-04 02:36:33	@mmvk it basically will create an livestock standards board that will oversee much of the regulation in the state.
2980211	2009-11-04 04:13:54	@amandamcneil strangely, my main pet peeve with the new version is that they changed dianas name to anna.
2980211	2009-11-04 10:42:40	i managed to somehow wake up late. lets hope this isnt a theme for the day.
2980211	2009-11-04 11:22:37	that and, you know, i could use the practice writing in german writing to someone who wont make fun of me. :)
2980211	2009-11-04 12:10:37	@jmgold thanks. i will try my best to keep it that way.
2980211	2009-11-04 12:28:33	@jmgold do you think that a second viewing will ruin the apparently hilarious experience of the first viewing
2980211	2009-11-04 12:35:11	@jmgold if you do watch it, you should live tweet it to share in the hilarity. :p
2980211	2009-11-04 12:35:38	@jmgold some of my favorite tweeting is when people are mocking movies. :)

2980211	2009-11-04 15:39:18	@librarygurl i actually dont watch the office.
2980211	2009-11-04 15:39:44	@librarygurl except for 30 rock, half hour shows tend to not sit well with me.
2980211	2009-11-04 17:21:13	@helgagrace why dont you have the book i want why are you fining me :)
2980211	2009-11-04 19:34:53	@amandamcneil i love indian food, but my favorite indian place ever is in porter square, actually.
2980211	2009-11-04 19:43:30	@amandamcneil yes 6, if thats okay with you. takes me slightly longer to get out there and i need some time to go home first.
2980211	2009-11-04 22:53:32	alright. im headed out to the north end for the evening
2980211	2009-11-05 12:47:30	oh, and now i really want to watch hamlet 2 again...#tbtl
2980211	2009-11-05 13:11:31	my attention span seems to be astonishingly short this morning. im sure more coffee isnt going to help either.
2980211	2009-11-05 13:27:45	finally listening to the carnegie hall ep of #waitwait. listening closely to hear @ohhleary and @jaimealyse clapping.

12098632	2009-11-04 04:00:37	@therealburgo pretty much. the operators say: you there come here and learn our #selfcheckout system. that was literally it. no choice.
12098632	2009-11-04 04:01:42	@vealmince thats the thing. if the #selfcheckouts would work properly i wouldnt complain. but they have constant errors

12098632	2009-11-04 04:32:41	@perkler the #selfcheckouts are slower, buggy, annoying cos you have to pack your own bags and i miss the checkout staff i talk to

12098632	2009-11-04 05:00:51	@cubeform sigh my experience with it systems leads me to believe the #selfcheckouts will be more expensive than checkout ppl
12098632	2009-11-04 05:01:33	@tmofee home delivery is ok, but i still like browsing in the supermarket #selfcheckouts
